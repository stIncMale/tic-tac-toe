## About

A multiplayer turn-based game.
The game rules are simple and can be read at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe>.

The application is intended to be interoperable with its
[Python](https://www.python.org/) counterpart
[Yo1k/tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/Yo1k/tic-tac-toe).
The goals of this project are to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
and to help my [brother](https://github.com/Yo1k) with learning programming.

Can run in one of the two modes:

* interactive;
* dedicated server.

### Interactive mode
The interactive mode is the default one and allows playing offline against an AI,hosting a game,
joining a game as a guest.

### Dedicated server mode
The dedicated server mode allows guests to join, find other players and play with them.

### Warning
The project is being developed, not all functionality is implemented.
