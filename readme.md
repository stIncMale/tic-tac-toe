## About

A multiplayer turn-based game. The application is intended to be interoperable with its
[Python](https://www.python.org/) counterpart
[Yo1k/tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/Yo1k/tic-tac-toe).

The goals of this project are to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
and to help my [brother](https://github.com/Yo1k) with learning programming.

## [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/stIncMale/tic-tac-toe/blob/master/contributing.md)
